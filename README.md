DaMaCrypt-Client
================

Java based, encrypted chat project

This is the client-side of the DaMa-Crypt chat project.

The goal of DaMa-Crypt is to grant a encrypted chat system to everyone. The messages you send to your chat partners are your private stuff. Nobody should have the right to read and know what you're talking about.

To keep your chats private the DaMa-Team is developing a well encrypted chat, free and easy to use for everyone.

Please remember this project is still under developing and in a very early BETA-state. So stay tuned to recongnize the final release.
